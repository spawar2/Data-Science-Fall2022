# Author: Pawar, Date: 09/23/2022, Purpose: Calculate T test for sample data.

# Generates 2 varaibles/groups called x and y
x = rnorm(10)
y = rnorm(10)

# Generates data points in sequence from -4.5 to 4.5
pts = seq(-4.5,4.5,length=100)

# Plots x and y to visualize distribution curve
plot(pts,dt(pts,df=9),col='red',type='l')
